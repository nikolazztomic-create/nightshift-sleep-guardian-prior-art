Full description of the invention:
A mobile application (Android and/or iOS) that allows on-call and night-shift workers to sleep without unnecessary wake-ups.

The user selects one messaging application (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Signal, Microsoft Teams, etc.) that is used for work call-outs.

The user enables recurring alarms (every 15–30 minutes) during sleep hours — either created by the app itself using AlarmManager/PendingIntent or by external alarm apps.

A background service continuously or periodically monitors incoming direct messages/private messages in the selected messaging app using official system APIs (Android NotificationListenerService or iOS equivalent).

10 minutes (user-configurable) before each upcoming alarm, the app checks the timestamp of the last qualifying message.

- If no message in the last X minutes → the app silently cancels/skips/prevents the next alarm from firing.
- If a message arrived in the last X minutes → the alarm rings normally.

This exact proactive cancellation based on recent DMs in one specific app does not exist in any publicly available app as of November 18, 2025.

This document is intentionally published as prior art to prevent patenting by anyone worldwide.
